For wired display, I'm using splashtop's WiredxDisplay.

Download splashtop wiredxdisplay windows client on Windows PC and Splashtop WiredXdisplay on Ipad Apple app store.

Then download Apple's Itunes, it'll automatically include a driver for the wired display.

After installing everything and get it running, in the windows client I configured the display to EXTEND display instead of MIRROR.
Lastly, with the extended display, i have full control of the resolution of the display and configure it to mirror display.
